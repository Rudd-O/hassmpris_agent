* support for handling rate (I think in media_player.py it's called speed)
* support for features like Quit() and to launch "off" players too
* support for artist / album / singer / track number
* support for media artwork
* media enqueue and playlist management support
* multi-user support (choose random ports and remember them)
  * the UI should obviously display which ports it is using
  * some server.py changes required to try a set of ports and
    pick / remember the ones that succeeded, noting in the
    UI which ports were picked, and properly announce these
    ports via zeroconf
