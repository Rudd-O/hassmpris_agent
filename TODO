* support for handling rate (I think in media_player.py it's called speed)
* support for features like Quit() and to launch "off" players too
* support for artist / album / singer / track number
* support for media artwork
* media enqueue and playlist management support
* multi-user support (choose random ports and remember them)
* support for mDNS / Avahi â€” with emphasis on multi-user support
  * mDNS records should include a unique ID so that the published ports can be matched to an existing configuration
  * the Home Assistant integration should make sense of it, updating the ports and reconnecting if that is the case)
